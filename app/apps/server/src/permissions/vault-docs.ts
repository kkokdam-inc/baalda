/**
 * The set of doc_ids in a vault a user may **read** (spec 05 §3.1). This is the
 * set-based dual of `effectivePermission` ([[resolver]]) for one whole vault, so
 * the vault channel can compute a subscriber's readable set in a couple of
 * queries instead of one resolve per doc.
 *
 * Mirrors the resolver exactly (here "vault" is the note collection; the
 * owner/admin/member role belongs to its owning organization, the user-facing
 * vault):
 *   - a vault-scoped view/edit grant (org-wide "Open"/"Read-only" for
 *     members, or per-user) -> every (non-deleted) note + file in the vault.
 *     Owner and admin reach this through the org-wide grant like anyone else,
 *     so a Private vault (no grant) leaves them scoped too;
 *   - otherwise             -> docs reachable via a share (view/edit) on the doc
 *     itself or any ancestor folder (folder grants inherit down), plus the docs
 *     the caller created — except in a SEALED vault (the Access panel's
 *     Private), which drops authorship for everyone and leaves only the shares.
 *
 * `locked` is a cap overlay that only takes edit->view; it never grants read, so
 * it's absent here. `denied` (per-member "No access") IS here: it removes read,
 * so every set below subtracts it last — see `deniedDocsInVault`.
 *
 * Read = view OR edit, so the channel streams content to view-only grantees too.

/**
 * Resolve a user's vault-level posture: their org, role, and whether they have
 * vault-wide read (a vault-scoped Open/Read-only grant, org-wide or per-user).
 *
 * Owner and admin used to answer `vaultWide: true` outright, before any grant
 * was read. That made a Private vault mean "private from the team" to a member
 * and nothing at all to the person who set it, and it was the single widest
 * bypass in the system: this one boolean feeds the readable set, the folder
 * tree, blob reads, the graph, MCP search, the registry pull and the live
 * channel's `ready.revoked`. The role now buys exactly what it buys everywhere
 * else — the org-wide grant, which Shared and Read-only write and Private does
 * not — so all eight surfaces follow the posture without a line of their own.
 * See [[resolver]] `vaultBaseline`.
 *
 * A person's OWN vault level (`personal`, a per-user row on the vault resource)
 * replaces the org posture for them — [[resolver]] `personalVaultLevel`:
 * `edit`/`view` is vault-wide read whatever the posture, `denied` is NOT
 * vault-wide read even in a Shared vault.

/**
 * doc_ids in this vault the caller could read but that are now **soft-deleted**.
 *
 * Why this exists: "absent from `GET /api/notes`" is ambiguous — it means either
 * *deleted* or *you lost read access*, because that route is ACL-filtered.
 * Absence alone can't distinguish them, and neither can `effectivePermission`:
 * `locateDoc` filters `deleted_at IS NULL`, so a deleted doc resolves to "none",
 * exactly like no access. So deletion has to be *stated*, never inferred.
 *
 * Both outcomes now remove the local file (a revocation that leaves a readable
 * `.md` on the ex-reader's disk is cosmetic), but they remain distinct: the
 * client caps them against separate budgets and reports them differently, and
 * an unanswered tombstone question still means "change nothing" — see
 * `lib/sync/inbound.ts`.
 *
 * Permission-filtered rather than "every deleted id in the vault". If a teammate
 * lost the share AND the note was deleted, the id is withheld and the client
 * falls into its "absent from both" branch — where the file is removed as a
 * REVOCATION rather than as a delete.
 *
 * That fallback is the harsher route, not the gentler one, and it is worth being
 * plain about: a revocation is removed outright with no `.context/trash` copy,
 * and on an authoritative pass its cap is lifted. So every case where a doc the
 * caller could once read is *deleted* must be answered here rather than left to
 * fall through — which is why the `deleted` branch resolves a share through
 * `folder_tombstones` when the folder that carried it has been hard-deleted.
 * An endpoint that cannot answer at all still means "change nothing".
